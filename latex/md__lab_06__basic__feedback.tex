\subsubsection*{Testing Mutants}

{\itshape {\bfseries{Note\+: This is just the basic feedback. The full feedback is run daily as a batch process (click link below)}}}

Link to full feedback\+: \mbox{\hyperlink{md__lab_06__full__feedback}{Lab\+\_\+06\+\_\+\+Full\+\_\+\+Feedback.md}}

{\bfseries{Below are the mutants that your tests will need to find for the Full Feedback}}\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Mutant\+:}} Dates from Get\+Date are missing a character
\item {\bfseries{Mutant\+:}} Some dates dont have leading zeroes
\item {\bfseries{Mutant\+:}} Todays date month off by one
\item {\bfseries{Mutant\+:}} Dates from Get\+Us\+Date are not in the right format (same as Get\+Date?)
\item {\bfseries{Mutant\+:}} operator-\/\+: Probably a copy paste error
\item {\bfseries{Mutant\+:}} Days between calculation seems to be much larger than it should be.
\item {\bfseries{Mutant\+:}} A test failed on the correct version of the program.\+Developer thought months should be zero-\/indexed\+Dates constructed with epoch are about 70 years in the future
\item {\bfseries{Mutant\+:}} 1/1/2016 to 3/1/2016 is 60 days, but this version returns 59
